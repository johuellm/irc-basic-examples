This repository code contains two example Internet Relay Chat (IRC) clients implementing the bare basics of the [RFC 1459](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1459) protocol. The client connects to an IRC server, stays connected, and responds to basic messages. It provides the current weather data for the German city of MÃ¼nster upon request by consuming a public REST API.
